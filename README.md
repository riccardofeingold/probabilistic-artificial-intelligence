## Task 0: Implementation of Baysian Interference
The goal of this simple exercise is to calculate the posterior probabilities of $P(H_i|X)$ for $i=1,2,3$ using Bayes theorem. According this formula, the probability of the hypothesis $H_i$ given $X$ can be calculated by multiplying the sum of the porbability of all $X$ given $H_i$ with the corresponding prior probability for the hypothetis $H_i$. All this is divided by the marginal likelihood.
